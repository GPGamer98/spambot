DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------
A small but very powerful universal spambot!

HOW TO USE
--------------------------------------------
Note: You need to have Python installed!

In the downloaded folder you'll see a text file called "words.txt"
![words](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89650503/162260328-679ed497-d825-422a-a7b6-980f74f37539.png)
you have to write the words that the spambot has to write (phrases are fine too, you can also go to line),
![scrivere parole](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89650503/162260724-f0b32d26-8271-458f-96c6-ebcaaacebcf6.png)
then save the file and run the file called "spambot.py"
